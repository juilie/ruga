I, Ruth Garbus, discovered a new planet last night. Beta X Presauri ii0 a.e3 is a Obloid Gaseous Giant with 5 moons. 

Notably, the Outer Layer of the manifold stratosphere is comprised of a hydrophobic gas, pushing â‰¥1.0 density gases downward, creating a Level 3 atmospheric pressure.

Here's a song I wrote about it. You can read my research [here](https://google.com).
