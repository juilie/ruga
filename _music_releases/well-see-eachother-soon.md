  I should have released these two tracks about 8 months ago when I wrote them.
  I was saving them for some imagined perfect release, a full album that would
  include the batch of songs I was going to record back in March 2020 before the
  pandemic changed those plans. I realized with a sick shock about two months
  ago that I’d made a mistake. I was reading an interview with a famous director
  who was talking about sacrifice. “Nobody talks about artist’s sacrificing
  anymore,” he said, or something like that. I had something like the inverse of
  an “aha” moment, maybe an “oh no” moment is what it was, but it did feel like
  an epiphany. I suddenly realized with horror that I’d been focused on
  strategizing and maximizing when I could have prioritized giving my music over
  fully to a greater service. If nothing else, music can help other humans feel
  emotions and digest the complex energies that flow through and around us all
  day long and through the night. By holding back when the songs were fresh I
  maybe missed the opportunity to provide some solace during a really rough
  time.


  Now that the vaccines are rolling out, I hope it’s not too late, and that these songs will still serve a purpose in this world!


  Thanks so much for listening :)

  Ruth
