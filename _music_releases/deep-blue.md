description: >-
  Soaring melodies and soothing tones, BLUE DISH’s sophomore album welcomes you
  Into the Blue. Drawing upon a vast array of influences — from Jazz to Blues
  (and even Classical) — BLUE DISH defies genre at every moment. Rather than
  rushing the album to meet a deadline, the duo took their time, finding the
  right melodies, the right chords, and the right Sound.


  BLUE DISH will be celebrating the release of their album on Saturday, January 28th at the Echo Lounge or the Blue Moose Bistro @ 8:15 in Brattleboro.
